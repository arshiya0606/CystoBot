### Project Description
CystoBot is an interactive chatbot designed to raise awareness and facilitate early detection of PCOS/PCOD by providing users with personalized symptom analysis, remedies, and lifestyle recommendations. It educates users on managing symptoms with a healthy lifestyle, balanced nutrition, and exercise.
### Problem Statement
PCOS/PCOD is often underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness, leading to untreated symptoms and long-term health complications. Most women are unaware of the symptoms, and early intervention is crucial.
### The Solution
CystoBot addresses the gap in awareness and early detection by offering a conversational approach to help users identify potential symptoms of PCOS/PCOD. It provides personalized recommendations for remedies, lifestyle tips, and nutrition advice, empowering users to take control of their health.

How the Software Works
User Interface:
The chatbot is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. When a user interacts with the chatbot, they answer questions about PCOS/PCOD symptoms, and the chatbot provides remedies based on those answers.
Question Flow:
The user is presented with a series of questions about PCOS/PCOD symptoms.
Based on their answers, CystoBot keeps track of their responses and shows relevant remedies at the appropriate times.
Dynamic Content:
JavaScript handles dynamic changes in content:
It displays questions progressively.
It provides symptom-specific remedies in real-time.
It adjusts the content based on the userâ€™s input (e.g., "Yes" or "No" answers).
Animations & Effects:
CSS animations such as fade-in, fade-out, and bounce effects are used for smooth transitions between questions and remedies.
Remedies Logic:
After each question, if the user answers "Yes," the chatbot displays a corresponding remedy. This logic is implemented in JavaScript, where each symptom triggers a specific advice or recommendation.
## Installation
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the project folder in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
You can open the index.html file in any modern browser to view the project.
## Run
Simply double-click the index.html file or right-click and select "Open with" followed by a browser of choice. No additional setup or installation is required.
## Project Documentation
For software:HTML Structure:
The core structure is composed of sections like:
PCOS/PCOD explanation
Chatbox interface (questions and answers)
Remedy section
Meal and exercise suggestions
CSS Styling:
The design is made visually appealing with animations, responsive layout, and user-friendly interactions.
JavaScript Logic:
Question Display: Functions like displayQuestion() manage the transition between questions.
Answer Handling: Functions like answerQuestion(answer) handle user input and show remedies.
Final Recommendations: The function showFinalMessage() aggregates answers and suggests further actions.

## Diagram
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b890f8d8-9bdd-4739-830c-90ba74dcff2a):We conducted a survey using Google Forms as part of our research on chatbot applications. The survey findings revealed a significant lack of awareness and delayed detection of PCOS/PCOD in today's time. This insight motivated us to develop a chatbot aimed at raising awareness, providing early insights, and guiding individuals toward better understanding and timely management of PCOS/PCOD.This image depicts a pie chart of the survey conducted through google form regarding symptoms of PCOS/PCOD.
